# Termostat_blink
Starting with CUBE on the barking bunny board


The eclipse was downloaded from AC6 (http://www.openstm32.org/HomePage)
installed as described.

The additional tools were installed arm-none-eabi-gdb
and tool for using a stlink with gdb server https://github.com/texane/stlink

The eclipse was set according this manual:
http://erika.tuxfamily.org/wiki/index.php?title=Tutorial:_STM32_-_Integrated_Debugging_in_Eclipse_using_GNU_toolchain&oldid=5474
and debug started.

Main points:
 * the gdb server start after the st-util is run.
 *  the st-link needs to been updated (with new firmware)
 *
